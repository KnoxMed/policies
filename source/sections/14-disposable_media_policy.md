# 14. Disposable Media Policy

Aluna recognizes that media containing personal information may be reused when appropriate steps are taken to ensure that all stored personal information has been effectively rendered inaccessible. Destruction/disposal of personal information shall be carried out in accordance with federal and state law. The schedule for destruction/disposal shall be suspended for personal information involved in any open investigation, audit, or litigation.

Aluna utilizes dedicated hardware from Subcontractors. All SSD volumes utilized by Aluna and Aluna Customers are encrypted. Aluna does not use, own, or manage any mobile devices, SD cards, or tapes that have access to personal information.


## 14.1 Disposable Media Policy

1. All removable media is restricted, audited, and is encrypted.
2. Aluna assumes all disposable media in its Platform may contain personal information, so it treats all disposable media with the same protections and disposal policies.
3. All destruction/disposal of personal information media will be done in accordance with federal and state laws and regulations and pursuant to the Aluna's written retention policy/schedule. Records that have satisfied the period of retention will be destroyed/disposed of in an appropriate manner.
4. Records involved in any open investigation, audit or litigation should not be destroyed/disposed of. If notification is received that any of the above situations have occurred or there is the potential for such, the record retention schedule shall be suspended for these records until such time as the situation has been resolved. If the records have been requested in the course of a judicial or administrative hearing, a qualified protective order will be obtained to ensure that the records are returned to the organization or properly destroyed/disposed of by the requesting party.
5. Before reuse of any media, for example all data is rendered inaccessible, cleaned, or scrubbed. All media is formatted to restrict future access.
6. All Aluna Subcontractors provide that, upon termination of the contract, they will return or destroy/dispose of all personal information. In cases where the return or destruction/disposal is not feasible, the contract limits the use and disclosure of the information to the purposes that prevent its return or destruction/disposal.
7. Any media containing personal information is disposed using a method that ensures the personal information could not be readily recovered or reconstructed.
8. The methods of destruction, disposal, and reuse are reassessed periodically, based on current technology, accepted practices, and availability of timely and cost-effective destruction, disposal, and reuse technologies and services.
