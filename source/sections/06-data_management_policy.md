# 6. Data Management Policy

Aluna has procedures to create and maintain retrievable exact copies of its data. The policy and procedures will assure that complete, accurate, retrievable, and tested backups are available for all systems used by Aluna.

Data backup is an important part of the day-to-day operations of Aluna. To protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data, both for Aluna and Aluna Customers, complete backups are done daily to assure that data remains available when it needed and in case of a disaster.

Violation of this policy and its procedures by workforce members may result in corrective disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
