# 4. Risk Management Policy

This policy establishes the scope, objectives, and procedures of Aluna's information security risk management process. The risk management process is intended to support and protect the organization and its ability to fulfill its mission.

## 4.1 Risk Management Policies

1. It is the policy of Aluna to conduct thorough and timely risk assessments of the potential threats and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of personal information (and other confidential and proprietary electronic information) it stores, transmits, and/or processes for its Customers and to develop strategies to efficiently and effectively mitigate the risks identified in the assessment process as an integral part of the Aluna's information security program.
2. Aluna implements security measures sufficient to reduce risks and vulnerabilities to a reasonable and appropriate level to:
   1. Ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all personal information Aluna receives, maintains, processes, and/or transmits for its Customers;
   2. Protect against any reasonably anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of Customer personal information;
   3. Protect against any reasonably anticipated uses or disclosures of Customer personal information that are not permitted or required; and
   4. Ensure compliance by all workforce members.
5. All Aluna workforce members are expected to fully cooperate with all persons charged with doing risk management work, including contractors and audit personnel. Any workforce member that violates this policy will be subject to disciplinary action based on the severity of the violation, as outlined in the Aluna Roles Policy.
6. The implementation, execution, and maintenance of the information security risk analysis and risk management process is the responsibility of Aluna's Security Officer (or other designated employee), and the identified Risk Management Team.
7. All risk management efforts, including decisions made on what controls to put in place as well as those to not put into place, are documented and the documentation is maintained for six years.
8. The details of the Risk Management Process, including risk assessment, discovery, and mitigation, are outlined in detail below. The process is tracked, measured, and monitored using the following procedures:
  1. The Security Officer or the Privacy Officer initiates the Risk Management Procedures by creating an Issue in the Aluna Quality Manageement System.
  2. The Security Officer or the Privacy Officer is assigned to carry out the Risk Management Procedures.
  3. All findings are documented in an approved spreadsheet that is linked to the Issue.
  4. Once the Risk Management Procedures are complete, along with corresponding documentation, the Security Officer approves or rejects the Issue. If the Issue is rejected, it goes back for further review and documentation.
  5. If the review is approved, the Security Officer then marks the Issue as Done, adding any pertinent notes required.
9. The Risk Management Procedure is monitored on a quarterly basis using the Quality Manageement System reporting to assess compliance with above policy.

### 4.2.2 Risk Mitigation

Risk mitigation involves prioritizing, evaluating, and implementing the appropriate risk-reducing controls recommended from the Risk Assessment process to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of Aluna Platform data. Determination of appropriate controls to reduce risk is dependent upon the risk tolerance of the organization consistent with its goals and mission.

* Step 1. Prioritize Actions
  * Using results from Step 7 of the Risk Assessment, sort the threat and vulnerability pairs according to their risk-levels in descending order. This establishes a prioritized list of actions needing to be taken, with the pairs at the top of the list getting/requiring the most immediate attention and top priority in allocating resources
  * Output - Actions ranked from high to low

* Step 2. Evaluate Recommended Control Options
  * Although possible controls for each threat and vulnerability pair are arrived at in Step 8 of the Risk Assessment, review the recommended control(s) and alternative solutions for reasonableness and appropriateness. The feasibility (e.g., compatibility, user acceptance, etc.) and effectiveness (e.g., degree of protection and level of risk mitigation) of the recommended controls should be analyzed. In the end, select a "most appropriate" control option for each threat and vulnerability pair.
  * Output - list of feasible controls

* Step 3. Conduct Cost-Benefit Analysis
  * Determine the extent to which a control is cost-effective. Compare the benefit (e.g., risk reduction) of applying a control with its subsequent cost of application. Controls that are not cost-effective are also identified during this step. Analyzing each control or set of controls in this manner, and prioritizing across all controls being considered, can greatly aid in the decision-making process.
  * Output - Documented cost-benefit analysis of either implementing or not implementing each specific control

* Step 4. Select Control(s)
  * Taking into account the information and results from previous steps, Aluna's mission, and other important criteria, the Risk Management Team determines the best control(s) for reducing risks to the information systems and to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of personal information. These controls may consist of a mix of administrative, physical, and/or technical safeguards.
  * Output - Selected control(s)

* Step 5. Assign Responsibility
  * Identify the workforce members with the skills necessary to implement each of the specific controls outlined in the previous step, and assign their responsibilities. Also identify the equipment, training and other resources needed for the successful implementation of controls. Resources may include time, money, equipment, etc.
  * Output - List of resources, responsible persons and their assignments

* Step 6. Develop Safeguard Implementation Plan
  * Develop an overall implementation or action plan and individual project plans needed to implement the safeguards and controls identified. The Implementation Plan should contain the following information:
    * Each risk or vulnerability/threat pair and risk level;
    * Prioritized actions;
    * The recommended feasible control(s) for each identified risk;
    * Required resources for implementation of selected controls;
    * Team member responsible for implementation of each control;
    * Start date for implementation
    * Target date for completion of implementation;
    * Maintenance requirements.
  * The overall implementation plan provides a broad overview of the safeguard implementation, identifying important milestones and timeframes, resource requirements (staff and other individuals' time, budget, etc.), interrelationships between projects, and any other relevant information. Regular status reporting of the plan, along with key metrics and success indicators should be reported to Aluna Senior Management.
  * Individual project plans for safeguard implementation may be developed and contain detailed steps that resources assigned carry out to meet implementation timeframes and expectations. Additionally, consider including items in individual project plans such as a project scope, a list deliverables, key assumptions, objectives, task completion dates and project requirements.
  * Output - Safeguard Implementation Plan

* Step 7. Implement Selected Controls
  * As controls are implemented, monitor the affected system(s) to verify that the implemented controls continue to meet expectations. Elimination of all risk is not practical. Depending on individual situations, implemented controls may lower a risk level but not completely eliminate the risk.
  * Continually and consistently communicate expectations to all Risk Management Team members, as well as senior management and other key people throughout the risk mitigation process. Identify when new risks are identified and when controls lower or offset risk rather than eliminate it.
  * Additional monitoring is especially crucial during times of major environmental changes, organizational or process changes, or major facilities changes.
  * If risk reduction expectations are not met, then repeat all or a part of the risk management process so that additional controls needed to lower risk to an acceptable level can be identified.
  * Output - Residual Risk documentation

### 4.3.3 Risk Management Schedule

The two principle components of the risk management process - risk assessment and risk mitigation - will be carried out according to the following schedule to ensure the continued adequacy and continuous improvement of Aluna's information security program:

* Scheduled Basis - an overall risk assessment of Aluna's information system infrastructure will be conducted annually. The assessment process should be completed in a timely fashion so that risk mitigation strategies can be determined and included in the corporate budgeting process.
* Throughout a System's Development Life Cycle - from the time that a need for a new, untested information system configuration and/or application is identified through the time it is disposed of, ongoing assessments of the potential threats to a system and its vulnerabilities should be undertaken as a part of the maintenance of the system.
* As Needed - the Security Officer (or other designated employee) or Risk Management Team may call for a full or partial risk assessment in response to changes in business strategies, information technology, information sensitivity, threats, legal liabilities, or other significant factors that affect Aluna's Platform.

## 4.4 Process Documentation

Maintain documentation of all risk assessment, risk management, and risk mitigation efforts for a minimum of six years.
